Build and Deploy Backend Services
=================================

When deploying a backend service, Maya will generate a zip file and upload it to Zengine.

The build process was designed to generate a zip file that only has the essential files required to run your backend code in production.
That said, it is important to understand how the build process works, to make sure the backend code is structured accordingly.

-----------
Dist folder
-----------

On the build process, Maya will: 

* copy the essential files to a folder named ``dist``
* do some additional work on that folder
* zip that ``dist`` folder to a file named ``dist.zip``

Those are the files and folders that will be copied to ``dist``:

* _runner
* lib
* src
* plugin.js
* package.json

``_runner``, ``lib``, ``plugin.js`` and ``package.json`` are standard for Zengine backend services.

The ``src`` folder is meant to include the files that you want to ship to production. Usually those are additional javascript files.
Why? This way, you can have test and docs files in other folders and maya won't bother to include those in the zip file.

After the files are copied, Maya will execute the command ``npm install --production`` in the dist folder.

Why? When developing in Node.js, we should be able to use ``devDependencies``, which are just like ``dependencies``, except that they are only relevant during development. Examples include test and linting libs.
We shouldn't send those to production â€“ not only because they are not relevant but also because they increase the zip file size. That command will generate a ``node_modules`` folder inside ``dist`` that only has the production modules.

---------------------------------
Build hook and environment settings
---------------------------------

Sometimes you need to generate a different build file for each environment.

In the ``package.json`` file, you can define a script called ``maya-build``.

If it exists, Maya will run that script right before zipping the dist folder. The script is run inside the service folder (not the dist folder).

An environment variable named ``MAYA_ENV`` will be set with the environment name (as specified in ``maya.json``).

For example, in ``package.json`` you could do::

  "scripts": {
    "maya-build": "cp config-$MAYA_ENV.json dist/config.json"
  }

Then your service could read settings from ``config.json`` and you could have ``config-dev.json`` and ``config-prod.json`` for 2 maya environments named ``dev`` and ``prod``.

``maya service build <service> --env=dev`` and ``maya service build <service> --env=prod`` would generate the zip files for each of those environments.

If your build process is more complex, you could delegate to a bash script and you would still have access to ``$MAYA_ENV`` from there.

-------------
Common issues
-------------

**"The plugin runner or libraries code can't be modified."**

Download the zip from Zengine again, delete ``_runner`` and ``lib`` (both on the backend service folder and the corresponding dist folder). Paste the ``_runner`` and ``lib`` from the downloaded zip on the backend service folder.

Warning: Sometimes when you download the ``_runner`` folder from Zengine, it doesn't come with ``_runner/config.json``. Make sure you have that file.
